Cookies are small files that the Site or our service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser that enables the Site’s or service provider’s systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. We use cookies to help us understand how users use the Site. For example, cookies gather information about how long you spend on a web page so that we can understand what web pages are of most interest to users. If you prefer, you can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off cookies by adjusting your browser settings. If you turn off your cookies, some of the features on the Site may not function properly. Google Analytics We use cookies provided by Google Analytics, a third-party service provider, to assist us in better understanding our Site visitors. These cookies collect data tied to a user’s IP address, such as the length of time a user spends on a page, the pages a user visits, and the websites a user visits before and after visiting the Site. Based on this information, Google Analytics compiles aggregate data about Site traffic and Site interactions, which we use to offer better Site experiences and tools in the future.

In contrast to cookies, which are stored in a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.

Affiliated companies: Other companies within the Jacksons family, for example, to provide you with our products and services.

In connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, bankruptcy, the sale of substantially all of our membership interests and/or assets or other corporate change, including to any prospective purchasers. The security and confidentiality of your personal information is important to us. We have technical, administrative, and physical security measures in place to protect your personal information from unauthorized access or disclosure and improper use. Only employees who need the personal information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to personal information. Employees with access to personal information are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to close your browser after you have completed your visit to the Site. Please note that despite our reasonable efforts, no security measure is ever perfect or impenetrable, so we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information. We will retain personal information necessary to comply with legal, administrative, or procedural requirements. A. Information About Disclosures of Personal Information Disclosures for Business Purposes Company has disclosed each of the categories of personal information listed in Section 1, above, for the following “business purposes”, as that term is defined under the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), in the last 12 months: Service providers: For the business purpose of performing services on Company’s behalf and, in particular, for the specific purposes described in Section 3, above. Auditors, lawyers, consultants, and accountants engaged by Company: For the business purpose of auditing compliance with policies and applicable laws, in addition to performing services on Company’s behalf. Affiliated companies: To other companies within the Jacksons family of companies for the business purposes of (1) auditing compliance with policies and applicable laws, (2) helping to ensure security and integrity, (3) debugging, (4) short-term transient use, (5) performing services on behalf of Company, (6) internal research, and (7) activities to maintain or improve the quality or safety of a service or device. Sales and Sharing We do not sell or share your personal information¸ where “share” means disclosing personal information to third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising. Without limiting the foregoing, we have not, and have no actual knowledge that we have, sold or “shared” the personal information of individuals of any age, including the personal information of children under 16, in the last 12 months. “Sell” is defined as making available personal information to “a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration.” “Share” is defined as making available personal information to “a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising, whether or not for monetary or other valuable consideration.” Aggregated and Deidentified Information We may aggregate and/or deidentify information, use it internally, and disclose it to third parties. Neither Aggregated Information nor Deidentified Information (defined below) is personal information. “Aggregated Information” refers to information about a group of individuals from which the individually identifiable information has been removed. An example of Aggregated Information would be the statistic that 20 people used our website’s contact form on a given day. “Deidentified Information” means information subjected to reasonable measures to ensure that the deidentified information cannot be associated with the individual. An example of Deidentified Information would be the data point that an unidentified visitor first entered the Site through our main web page. We maintain Deidentified Information in a deidentified form and do not attempt to reidentify it, except that we may attempt to reidentify the information just to determine whether our deidentification processes function correctly. [ B. Your California Privacy Rights Subject to applicable law, California residents have the following rights: Right to Know: You have the right to submit a verifiable request for specific pieces of your personal information and for information about Company’s collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information. In addition, you have a right to know the categories of your personal information that Company sold or shared for cross-context behavioral advertising and the parties to which those categories were sold or shared. Please note that the CPRA’s right to obtain “specific pieces” does not grant a right to the whole of any document that contains personal information, but only to copies of items of personal information. Moreover, California residents generally just have a right to know categories, for example, categories of third parties to which personal information is disclosed, but not the individual third parties. Right to Delete: You have the right to submit a verifiable request for the deletion of personal information that you have provided to Company. Right to Correct: You have the right to submit a verifiable request for the correction of inaccurate personal information maintained by Company, taking into account the nature of the personal information and the purposes of processing the personal information. Right to Opt out of Sale and Sharing: You have the right to opt out of the sale of your personal information and the disclosure of your personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising. You may also implement a browser setting or extension to communicate your selling and sharing preferences automatically to the websites you visit. We honor your right to opt out of the sale and sharing of your personal information as signaled by a universal opt out signal or Global Privacy Control (“GPC”). To enable GPC, you can visit the Global Privacy Control page at https://globalprivacycontrol.org. If you download a supported browser or extension and exercise your privacy rights with GPC, we will turn off certain third-party cookies on our website after our website detects a GPC signal. However, if you visit our website from a different device or from a different browser on the same device, you will need to opt-out or use an opt-out preference signal for that browser and/or device. C. How to Exercise Your Rights Company will respond to requests to know, delete, and correct in accordance with applicable law if it can verify the identity of the individual submitting the request. You may opt out of the disclosure of your personal information for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising or the sale of your personal information. To exercise your rights, click here: https://privacy-jacksons.msappproxy.net/ D. How We Will Verify Your Request If you submit a request through an adequately secure password-protected account that you created before the date of your request, we will use the authentication mechanisms in the account to verify your identity. Otherwise, we match personal information that you provide us against personal information we maintain in our files. The more risk entailed by the request (e.g., a request for specific pieces of personal information), the more items of personal information we may request to verify your identity. If we cannot verify your identity to a sufficient level of certainty to respond securely to your request, we will let you know promptly and explain why we cannot verify your identity. E. Authorized Agents You may designate an authorized agent to exercise your right to know, to correct, or to delete. If an authorized agent submits a request on your behalf, the authorized agent must submit with the request another document signed by you that authorizes the authorized agent to submit the request on your behalf. In addition, we may ask you or your authorized agent to follow the applicable process described above for verifying your identity. You can obtain the “Authorized Agent Designation” form by contacting us at https://privacy-jacksons.msappproxy.net/ In the alternative, you can provide a power of attorney compliant with the California Probate Code. F. Company’s Non-Discrimination Policy Company will not unlawfully discriminate against you for exercising your privacy rights under the California Privacy Rights Act. If we change this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on this page and update the Privacy Policy modification date above. If we materially change this Privacy Policy in a way that affects how we use or disclose your personal information, we will provide a prominent notice of such changes and the effective date of the changes before making them. For More Information For questions or concerns about Company’s privacy policies and practices, please contact us at https://privacy-jacksons.msappproxy.net/ Notice at Collection for California Residents: Company collects the personal information identified in Section 1 for the purposes identified in Section 3 and retains it for the period described in Section 6. We do not sell your personal information or disclose it for cross-context behavioral advertising (“sharing”). We also do not collect or process sensitive personal information for the purpose of inferring characteristics about you. To the extent you provide Company with personal information about other California residents, you are responsible for providing this notice to them. CHILDREN’S ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT COMPLIANCE We do not collect information from anyone under 13 years of age. The products and/or services we provide, together with our Site, are all directed to individuals who are at least 13 years old. If you are under the age of 13, you are not authorized to use our services or the Site. Scope This Privacy Policy applies to the personal information of individuals (“you”, “your”, or “yours”) collected by Company, including the personal information collected when you visit our website www.jacksons.com as it may be modified, relocated and/or redirected from time to time (the “Site”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to the personal information of individuals in their capacity as prospective, current, or former employees, contract workers, board members, or owners of Jacksons Food Stores LLC., or their emergency contacts, dependents, or beneficiaries. “Personal information” means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular individual or household. Other web sites The Site may contain links to other web sites not operated or controlled by use (“Third Party Sites”). The policies and procedures we describe here do not apply to Third Party Sites. The links from the Site do not imply that we endorse or have reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.
